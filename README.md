The typical frat guy's day starts with a early morning workout. They hit the weights hard, making sure to get in a good sweat before their day gets started. Then it's off to classes, where they focus on their studies and try to get good grades. Their dorm is usually pretty well-designed, with plenty of space for all of their stuff and nice lighting that makes it feel homey. At night, they let loose and enjoy the company of their friends, often while indulging in some lighthearted fun. Their dorms are designed to be comfortable and inviting places to relax after a long day or party all night long. No matter what time of day it is, frat guys always seem to be having a good time!
